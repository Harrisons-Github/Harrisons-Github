# About me

- 👋 Welcome to my Github profile! I'm an entry level SWE currently exploring the world of programming. I've recently created this Github account to better showcase my skills and show things that I work on during my free time.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything about computers and programming. I have a passion for exploring anything I can when it comes to the internet, especially when it involves cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust through "the book" and vidoes online. I'm absolutely loving all of it's features to ensure that I can't mess anything up.
- 💞️ I’m always open to collaborating with like minded people that want to better their skills and work on projects to become better

- Currently, I'm working on the Prime Number Theorem CLI tool that you can find a repo for on my page. If you have any questions or want to contact me, then please email me at moose3036@gmail.com
